## **‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation**

Follow these steps to get the frontend running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended)  
* pnpm package manager (or npm/yarn)  
* The backend server must be running.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   git clone \[https://github.com/your-username/your-frontend-repo-link.git\](https://github.com/your-username/your-frontend-repo-link.git)  
   cd your-frontend-repo-folder

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   pnpm install

3. Configure Environment Variables:  
   This project requires a single environment variable to know the address of the backend API. Create a new file named .env in the root of the project directory.  
   \# .env  
   REACT\_APP\_API\_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/chat

   *Note: The React code is already set up to use this variable. It will fall back to http://localhost:8000/api/chat if the variable is not set.*

### **Running the Development Server**

Start the Vite development server. The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

pnpm run dev

## **üì¶ Building for Production**

To create an optimized production build, run the following command. The output will be generated in the dist folder.

pnpm run build

## **‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment**

This application is built as a static site and is optimized for deployment on platforms like **Render**, **Vercel**, or **Netlify**.

When deploying, use the following settings:

* **Build Command:** pnpm run build  
* **Publish Directory:** dist

Remember to set the REACT\_APP\_API\_URL environment variable in your deployment platform's settings to the public URL of your live backend API.
